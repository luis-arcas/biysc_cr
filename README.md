# biysc_cr

This folder contains all the jupyter notebooks and python code lines used at the cosmic ray experiment at BIYSC. All the code included was used to obtain our results and process all the data gathered. I do also upload the article I prepared for the final challenge of the project. Even though it was not finally selected for the finals, I am quite proud of the effort I pulled, plus the results were very nice :)

Special thanks to Manujeet 'Manu', Àlex, Dani, Berta, Bethany, Anto, Sergi, Helena, Sophie, Sofía and David (last but not least) for their contributions and their commitment on the project. Without them this would have been literally imposible.
