# biysc_cr

This folder contains all the jupyter notebooks and python code lines used at the cosmic ray experiment at BIYSC. All the code included was used to obtain our results and process all the data gathered.

Special thanks to Manujeet 'Manu', Àlex, Dani, Berta, Bethany, Anto, Sergi, Helena, Sophie, Sofía and David (last but not least) for their contributions and their commitment on the project. Without them this would have been literally imposible.
